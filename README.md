Learning Java the Informatiker Way – Semester 1 ☕💻

This repository documents my journey learning Java during my first semester at THM (Informatik / BWL-Inf / related fields).
The focus isn't just on coding, but also on understanding concepts commonly covered in university: data types, control flow, OOP, and basic algorithms.

Primary language: English, occasionally mixed with German terms to align with course materials.
🎯 Repository Goals

Document my Java learning progress during semester 1.
Provide simple code examples that are:

easy to read,
well-commented,
relevant to basic programming courses/assignments.
Serve as "digital notes" for reviewing material before exams.
📚 Topics Covered

This repository will include examples and exercises for:

Java Basics

Java program structure (main, class, method)
Primitive data types & operators
Simple input/output
Control Flow

if, else if, switch
for, while, do-while
Arrays & Strings

1D arrays (and possibly 2D)
Basic array operations (search, min/max, etc.)
Basic String manipulation
Methods & Parameters

Methods with/without return values
Parameter passing (by value in Java)
OOP Fundamentals

class & object
constructor
this keyword
toString()
(Optional future topics)

Basic collections (ArrayList)
Simple algorithms (linear search, basic binary search, etc.)
Note: Structure and topics may change/expand as the semester progresses.
